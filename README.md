# Edge Predictor with Diffusion Model for DNA Binding Sites Prediction

A deep learning framework combining edge prediction and diffusion models for accurate DNA-protein binding site prediction.

## 🎯 Overview

This project implements an advanced graph neural network approach for predicting DNA binding sites in protein sequences. The model leverages:
- **Edge Predictor**: Captures structural relationships between amino acids
- **Diffusion Model**: Generates high-quality augmented training data
- **GAT-GNN**: Graph Attention Networks for binding site classification

## 🚀 Features

- DNA-binding site prediction for protein sequences
- Data augmentation using diffusion models
- Cross-validation and ensemble learning
- Support for multiple DNA-binding protein families (HTH, zinc finger, bHLH, homeodomain)
- PyMOL visualization scripts for 3D structure analysis

## 📦 Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)
